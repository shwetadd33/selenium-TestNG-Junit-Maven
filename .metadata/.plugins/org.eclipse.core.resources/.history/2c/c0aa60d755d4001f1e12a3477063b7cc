// Abstract Class: Abstract class is an incomplete class . It can be extended by other class. The objects of an Abstract class can not be created
// Abstract class can Implement an Interface
// Abstract class can be useful when:
// A class needs to implement Interface but does not want to define all the functions inside an Interface, since
// when class is implements Interface it needs to define all the functions that are defined inside Interface.
// So when class can not have all the function definitions within the interface it can be declared as Abstract as it provides a way 
// for class to be incomplete.


public abstract class Car implements CarMain {
	public void speed() {
		System.out.println("Inside Car class Speed");
	}
	
	public void refuel() {
		System.out.println("Inside Car class refuel");
	}
}
